# HACS Question Archetypes & Design Philosophy

## Introduction
HACS (Human-AI Comparative Score) Question Archetypes are abstract patterns for tasks that can be reliably performed by both humans and AI systems. Unlike SMF archetypes, which are designed to probe specific semantic capabilities of LLMs (sometimes using adversarial or highly technical structures), HACS archetypes are **universally accessible cognitive tasks**.

## Core Principles

1.  **Symmetry:** If a task is confusing or "unfair" to a human, it is invalid for HACS.
2.  **Abstracted Content:** Archetypes define the *structure* of the task, not the specific topic.
3.  **Non-Academic:** Tasks use natural language and general knowledge, avoiding jargon.
4.  **Resistance to Coaching:** The focus is on *how* the answer is constructed (maturity), not just factual correctness.

## Comparison with SMF Archetypes

| Feature | SMF Archetypes | HACS Archetypes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target** | AI-specific capabilities | Human-AI comparative maturity |
| **Difficulty** | Can be adversarial/impossible | Must be solvable by a thoughtful human |
| **Evaluation** | Technical correctness, robustness | Maturity, stability, reflection |
| **Content** | Can be synthetic/nonsense | Must be grounded in reality |

## Why Archetypes?
Using archetypes instead of fixed question sets allows us to:
-   **Prevent Overfitting:** We can generate infinite variations of the same cognitive task.
-   **Ensure Balance:** We guarantee coverage of all 5 modules.
-   **Maintain Quality:** Every concrete question is instantiated from a validated pattern.
