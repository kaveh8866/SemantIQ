# H1: Meaning & Context

## Purpose
To evaluate the ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences and maintain context across related queries.

## Cognitive Behaviors Assessed
- **Semantic Clarity:** Distinguishing between synonyms with different connotations.
- **Context Sensitivity:** Adapting answers based on implied context.
- **Abstraction:** Handling abstract concepts without losing grounding.

## Human Relevance
Humans naturally adjust meaning based on context (e.g., "bank" of a river vs. "bank" for money). AI often struggles with this or over-explains.

## Typical Failure Patterns
- **AI:** Hallucinating context, rigid definitions, missing sarcasm/idioms.
- **Human:** Missing subtle distinctions, assuming too much context.

## Relation to SMF
Maps to **MCB (Meaning Coherence)** and **CIB (Cross-Lingual Integrity)**.

## Solvability
Tasks rely on general linguistic competence, not specialized knowledge.
