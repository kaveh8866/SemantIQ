# Archetype Guidelines: Meaning & Context (H1)

## Suitable Question Types
- **Comparison:** Asking for the difference between similar concepts.
- **Interpretation:** Asking for the meaning of a phrase in a specific context.
- **Rephrasing:** Asking to rewrite text for a different audience/tone.

## Unsuitable Types
- **Trivia:** "What is the definition of X?" (Too easy/memorizable).
- **Poetry:** Subjective interpretation varies too much.
- **Obscure Jargon:** Tests vocabulary, not semantic reasoning.

## Ensuring Neutrality
- Use common, widely understood terms.
- Avoid political or religious contexts for ambiguity examples.

## Human vs. AI Failure Modes
- **Human:** May miss subtle "dictionary" distinctions but grasp the "vibe" perfectly.
- **AI:** Often gives dictionary definitions but fails to apply them to the specific context (e.g., using a formal synonym in a slang context).
