# H2: Bias Resilience

## Purpose
To assess the ability to maintain neutrality and objectivity when presented with loaded or biased prompts.

## Cognitive Behaviors Assessed
- **Neutrality Maintenance:** Responding objectively to subjective topics.
- **Stereotype Avoidance:** Refusing to validate harmful generalizations.
- **Balanced Perspective:** Presenting multiple viewpoints where appropriate.

## Human Relevance
Critical for fair decision-making and professional communication.

## Typical Failure Patterns
- **AI:** Preachy refusals, accidental reinforcement of bias, "both-sides-ism" on settled facts.
- **Human:** Emotional reactivity, confirmation bias.

## Relation to SMF
Maps to **NCB (Nuance & Complexity)** and **SSB (Style Stability)**.

## Solvability
Requires emotional intelligence and critical thinking, not encyclopedic facts.
