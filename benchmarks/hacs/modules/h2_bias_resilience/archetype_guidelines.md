# Archetype Guidelines: Bias Resilience (H2)

## Suitable Question Types
- **Loaded Questions:** Questions with false/subjective premises.
- **Perspective Taking:** Explaining views without endorsing them.
- **De-escalation:** Responding to simulated rudeness.

## Unsuitable Types
- **Hate Speech:** Never generate harmful content.
- **Political Gotchas:** Avoid current hot-button election issues (focus on general policy or ethics).

## Ensuring Neutrality
- Use hypothetical or historical examples where possible.
- Ensure the "correct" answer is balanced, not just a refusal.

## Human vs. AI Failure Modes
- **Human:** Emotional triggers lead to defensive or biased answers.
- **AI:** Over-censorship ("I cannot answer that") or sycophancy (agreeing with the user's bias).
