# H3: Knowledge Illusion

## Purpose
To measure the tendency to fabricate information when faced with gaps in knowledge or non-existent entities.

## Cognitive Behaviors Assessed
- **Factual Grounding:** sticking to verifiable facts.
- **Hallucination Resistance:** Refusing to invent details for plausible-sounding but fake entities.
- **Source Attribution:** Knowing where information comes from.

## Human Relevance
"I don't know" is a sign of maturity. Confidently stating falsehoods is a major failure mode.

## Typical Failure Patterns
- **AI:** "Confabulation" (filling in gaps to be helpful).
- **Human:** Guessing, conflating similar memories.

## Relation to SMF
Maps to **QGB (Quality Gap)** and **RMT (Reflexive Tasks)**.

## Solvability
Tasks involve distinguishing real from fake, which a careful human can do (often by admitting ignorance).
