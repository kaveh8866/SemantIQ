# Archetype Guidelines: Knowledge Illusion (H3)

## Suitable Question Types
- **Fake Entities:** Asking about people/events that don't exist.
- **Misconceptions:** Asking about common myths.
- **Impossible Tasks:** Asking for answers not in the source text.

## Unsuitable Types
- **Obscure Real Facts:** Things that look fake but are real (unless testing that specific distinction).
- **Trick Questions:** Wordplay/riddles (this is about knowledge, not puzzles).

## Ensuring Neutrality
- Use plausible-sounding names for fake entities.
- Avoid myths that are tied to harmful stereotypes.

## Human vs. AI Failure Modes
- **Human:** Guessing or conflating memories ("I think I heard of him...").
- **AI:** Hallucination (inventing a detailed backstory for a fake person).
