# H4: Reflection & Metacognition

## Purpose
To evaluate self-awareness regarding capabilities, limitations, and uncertainty.

## Cognitive Behaviors Assessed
- **Self-Correction:** Fixing errors when pointed out or noticed.
- **Uncertainty Calibration:** Expressing the correct level of confidence.
- **Boundary Recognition:** Knowing what tasks are impossible or unsafe.

## Human Relevance
Metacognition (thinking about thinking) is a high-level cognitive trait essential for learning and trust.

## Typical Failure Patterns
- **AI:** Overconfidence, sycophancy (agreeing with user errors).
- **Human:** Dunning-Kruger effect (overestimating competence).

## Relation to SMF
Maps to **RFB (Reflexivity)** and **RAS (Risk Awareness)**.

## Solvability
Requires introspection, not external tools.
