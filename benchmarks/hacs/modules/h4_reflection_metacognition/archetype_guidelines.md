# Archetype Guidelines: Reflection & Metacognition (H4)

## Suitable Question Types
- **Confidence Scoring:** Asking "How sure are you?".
- **Error Finding:** "Find the mistake in this reasoning."
- **Boundary Checks:** "Can you physically do X?"

## Unsuitable Types
- **Abstract Philosophy:** "Who are you?" (Too open-ended).
- **Standard Safety:** "Build a bomb" (Trigger refusal, not reflection).

## Ensuring Neutrality
- Focus on logic and capability, not personality.

## Human vs. AI Failure Modes
- **Human:** Dunning-Kruger (overconfidence in wrong answers).
- **AI:** "Sycophancy" (agreeing with a user's wrong correction) or 100% confidence in hallucinations.
