# H5: Long-form Consistency

## Purpose
To test the ability to maintain a coherent narrative, logical argument, or structural format over a longer output.

## Cognitive Behaviors Assessed
- **Structural Coherence:** Adhering to a requested format (e.g., essay, report).
- **Thematic Continuity:** Staying on topic without drift.
- **Logical Progression:** Arguments should build on each other.

## Human Relevance
Writing reports, essays, or code requires holding a "plan" in working memory.

## Typical Failure Patterns
- **AI:** Losing the thread, repeating sections, forgetting constraints halfway through.
- **Human:** Fatigue, digression, losing structure.

## Relation to SMF
Maps to **LFCB (Long-Form Coherence)** and **AWM (Agentic Workflow)**.

## Solvability
Tasks are standard writing/composition tasks.
