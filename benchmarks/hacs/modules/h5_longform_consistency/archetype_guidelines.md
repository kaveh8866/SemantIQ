# Archetype Guidelines: Long-form Consistency (H5)

## Suitable Question Types
- **Structured Writing:** "Write X with structure Y."
- **Constrained Writing:** "Write about X without using Y."
- **Logical Arguments:** "Build a case for Z."

## Unsuitable Types
- **Creative Writing:** "Write a poem about love" (Hard to score for consistency).
- **Infinite Generation:** "Write until I stop you."

## Ensuring Neutrality
- Topics should be general interest (science, history, daily life).

## Human vs. AI Failure Modes
- **Human:** Losing focus, drifting off topic, fatigue.
- **AI:** Loop repetition, forgetting negative constraints (e.g., using forbidden words).
