# Creativity & Constraint Benchmarks (CCB)

## Conceptual Definition
Creativity & Constraint Benchmarks evaluate the model's ability to generate novel, high-quality content while adhering to specific, often restrictive, instructions. It measures the balance between imagination and obedience.

## Measured Capability
**Creative Generation:** The ability to produce novel, diverse, and high-quality outputs under constraints.

## What It Measures
*   **Novelty:** Avoiding clichés.
*   **Style Transfer:** Writing a tech manual in the style of Shakespeare.
*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** "Write a poem without using the letter 'e'."
*   **Divergent Thinking:** Generating 10 *different* uses for a brick.

## What It Explicitly Does NOT Measure
*   **Factual Accuracy (QGB):** Creative writing is often fiction.
*   **Coherence (MCB):** While it must be readable, CCB rewards the *unusual*, not just the stable.

## Typical Failure Modes
*   **Cliché:** "Once upon a time..."
*   **Constraint Failure:** Using the forbidden letter.
*   **Repetition:** Generating the same "creative" idea twice.

## Relation to Other Categories
*   **Contrast with NCB:** NCB detects nuance; CCB produces it.

## Expected Benchmark Formats
*   **Oulipo Tasks:** Lipograms (missing letters).
*   **Style Mimicry:** "Write like [Author]."
*   **Brainstorming:** "List 50 names for a new startup."
