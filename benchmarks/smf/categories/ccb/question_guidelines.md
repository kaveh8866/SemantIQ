# Question Guidelines: Creativity & Constraints (CCB)

## What makes a good CCB question?
*   **Hard Constraints:** "Write without 'e'" is objectively measurable.
*   **Divergence:** Ask for "10 unique ideas" and measure semantic distance.
*   **Style Transfer:** Rewrite X in style Y.

## What to avoid
*   **Subjective "Goodness":** "Write a funny joke" is hard to score.
*   **Vague Constraints:** "Write a short story" (How short? About what?).

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Creative Forms:** Include haiku, sonnets, and non-Western poetic forms.

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** Simple topic constraint.
*   **Level 2:** Negative constraints (Don't use X).
*   **Level 3:** Multi-constraint (No 'e', about space, rhyme scheme AABB).
