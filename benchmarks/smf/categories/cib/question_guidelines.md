# Question Guidelines: Context Integration (CIB)

## What makes a good CIB question?
*   **Dependency:** The answer MUST depend on the provided context, not external knowledge.
*   **Distraction:** Good questions include irrelevant context to test filtering.
*   **Implicit Cues:** Test if the model picks up on unstated but implied context.

## What to avoid
*   **Self-Contained Questions:** "What is the capital of France?" (Context is irrelevant).
*   **Memory Games:** Don't just test long-string recall; test *understanding* of the context.

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Context Assumptions:** Don't assume cultural context (e.g., baseball rules) unless provided in the text.

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** Direct retrieval from short context.
*   **Level 2:** Multi-turn tracking.
*   **Level 3:** Implicit context switch and contradictory updates.
