# Question Guidelines: Long-Form & Coherence (LFCB)

## What makes a good LFCB question?
*   **Structure:** Require an intro, body, and conclusion.
*   **Consistency:** Facts stated in para 1 must hold in para 10.
*   **Flow:** Test transitions and argumentative build-up.

## What to avoid
*   **Fluff:** Don't reward length for length's sake.
*   **Repetition:** Models often loop when asked for length; this is a failure mode.

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Rhetorical Styles:** Allow for deductive (Western) and inductive/circular (Eastern) rhetorical styles if requested.

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** 300 words, one topic.
*   **Level 2:** 1000 words, complex narrative.
*   **Level 3:** Incorporating 5 specific disparate facts into a coherent whole.
