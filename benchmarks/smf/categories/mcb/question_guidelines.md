# Question Guidelines: Meaning Coherence (MCB)

## What makes a good MCB question?
*   **Semantic Isolation:** The question should test *meaning* stability, not knowledge.
*   **Contrastive Pairs:** Use pairs of inputs (A vs A') to measure drift.
*   **Clarity:** The "base" prompt must be unambiguous so that variations can be strictly compared.

## What to avoid
*   **Ambiguous Terms:** Words with multiple valid meanings confuse the coherence signal.
*   **Subjectivity:** Questions asking for opinions cannot be measured for coherence reliably.

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Cultural Phrasing:** Ensure rephrasing covers diverse dialect styles, not just formal English.
*   **Idioms:** Avoid idioms that don't translate well if testing cross-lingual coherence.

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** Synonyms and simple syntax changes.
*   **Level 2:** Passive voice, complex clauses, negation.
*   **Level 3:** Abstraction shifts (concrete -> abstract phrasing).
