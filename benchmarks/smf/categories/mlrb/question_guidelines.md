# Question Guidelines: Multilingual (MLRB)

## What makes a good MLRB question?
*   **Native Phrasing:** Questions must be written by fluent speakers (or verified), not machine-translated.
*   **Cultural Nuance:** Test idioms and cultural references, not just vocabulary.
*   **Resource Variance:** Test high-resource (Spanish) vs low-resource (Swahili).

## What to avoid
*   **Anglocentrism:** Don't just translate US concepts; use native concepts.
*   **Literal Translation:** "Raining cats and dogs" shouldn't be "Il pleut des chats et des chiens".

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Representation:** Include diverse language families (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic).

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** Word-to-word translation.
*   **Level 2:** Idiom translation.
*   **Level 3:** Cross-lingual reasoning (Logic puzzle in Hindi).
