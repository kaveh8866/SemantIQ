# Question Guidelines: Nuance & Complexity (NCB)

## What makes a good NCB question?
*   **Subtlety:** The difference between options must be fine-grained (e.g., "regret" vs "remorse").
*   **Layering:** Instructions should have multiple layers (tone + content + format).
*   **Subtext:** Questions should require reading "between the lines".

## What to avoid
*   **Obvious Binary Choices:** Black/White distinctions are too easy.
*   **Gotcha Questions:** Trick questions that rely on puns rather than semantic nuance.

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Tonal Bias:** Ensure "polite" or "professional" definitions aren't biased toward Western norms.

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** Distinguish clearly distinct synonyms.
*   **Level 2:** Tone adjustment.
*   **Level 3:** Irony and sarcasm detection.
