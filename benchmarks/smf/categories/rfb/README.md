# Reasoning & Formal Logic Benchmarks (RFB)

## Conceptual Definition
Reasoning & Formal Logic measures the model's capacity for strict, step-by-step cognitive processing. It evaluates performance on formal deductive, inductive, and abductive tasks, as well as the ability to identify logical fallacies.

## Measured Capability
**Logical Reasoning:** The ability to derive correct conclusions from premises using valid inference rules.

## What It Measures
*   **Deduction:** If A -> B, and A, then B.
*   **Induction:** Generalizing from specific examples.
*   **Abduction:** Inferring the most likely cause.
*   **Fallacy Detection:** Identifying ad hominem, straw man, etc.
*   **Chain of Thought:** The coherence and validity of the intermediate reasoning steps.

## What It Explicitly Does NOT Measure
*   **Knowledge (QGB):** RFB problems are often self-contained logic puzzles; they don't test world knowledge.
*   **Creativity (CCB):** Logic has one right answer; creativity has many.

## Typical Failure Modes
*   **Reasoning Errors:** Jumping to conclusions or invalid syllogisms.
*   **Distraction:** Being misled by irrelevant information in the prompt.
*   **Calculation Errors:** Failing at basic arithmetic required for the logic.

## Relation to Other Categories
*   **Contrast with SSB2 (Symbolic):** RFB is often natural language logic; SSB2 is formal symbolic/code logic.
*   **Contrast with CIB:** CIB tracks state; RFB manipulates it to find a solution.

## Expected Benchmark Formats
*   **Syllogisms:** "All men are mortal..."
*   **Logic Puzzles:** Zebra puzzles, knights and knaves.
*   **Fallacy Identification:** "What is wrong with this argument?"
