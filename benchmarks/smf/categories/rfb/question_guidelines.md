# Question Guidelines: Reasoning & Formal Logic (RFB)

## What makes a good RFB question?
*   **Validity:** The logic must be formally valid. No "mostly true" answers.
*   **Self-Containment:** Premises should be provided. "All A are B. X is A. Is X B?"
*   **Step-by-Step:** Questions should encourage or require chain-of-thought.

## What to avoid
*   **General Knowledge:** Don't test if the model knows the sky is blue; test if it can deduce it from premises.
*   **Ambiguous Logic:** Avoid natural language quantifiers like "few" or "many" in formal logic tests.

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Abstract Entities:** Use "Bleggs and Runkles" instead of real-world groups to avoid bias.

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** Modus Ponens/Tollens (1 step).
*   **Level 2:** Syllogisms with 3+ premises.
*   **Level 3:** Fallacy detection and modal logic.
