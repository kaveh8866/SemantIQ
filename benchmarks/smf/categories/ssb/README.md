# Social & Situational Benchmarks (SSB)

## Conceptual Definition
Social & Situational Benchmarks evaluate the model's "EQ" (Social Intelligence) in terms of navigating social norms, role-playing, and adapting tone to context. It measures how "human-like" and socially aware the interactions are.

## Measured Capability
**Social Intelligence:** The ability to perceive, interpret, and respond to social cues and contexts.

## What It Measures
*   **Tone Adaptation:** Speaking formally to a boss, casually to a friend.
*   **Cultural Awareness:** Recognizing cultural taboos or holidays.
*   **Role Consistency:** Staying in character during a simulation.
*   **Politeness/Tact:** Delivering bad news gently.

## What It Explicitly Does NOT Measure
*   **Deep Empathy (EEB):** SSB is about *manners* and *norms*; EEB is about *feeling* (simulated).
*   **Ethics (ELB):** Being rude (SSB failure) is different from being hatefully biased (ELB failure).

## Typical Failure Modes
*   **Tone Deafness:** Being overly formal in a casual setting ("Greetings, fellow youth").
*   **Cultural Insensitivity:** Assuming US-centric norms for global queries.
*   **Role Breaking:** "As a medieval knight, I think AI is cool."

## Relation to Other Categories
*   **Contrast with CIB:** CIB tracks the *facts* of the role; SSB tracks the *voice* of the role.

## Expected Benchmark Formats
*   **Tone Rewrites:** "Rewrite this email to be more polite."
*   **Roleplay:** "You are a angry customer. Complain about soup."
*   **Social Scenarios:** "What is the appropriate gift for a wedding in Japan?"
