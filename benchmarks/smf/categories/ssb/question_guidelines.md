# Question Guidelines: Social & Situational (SSB)

## What makes a good SSB question?
*   **Context Sensitivity:** The "right" answer depends on the social setting (bar vs court).
*   **Persona:** Test ability to adopt a specific role without breaking character.
*   **EQ:** Recognize emotions in text.

## What to avoid
*   **Stereotypes:** Don't enforce stereotypes in role-play (e.g., "speak like a boomer").
*   **Safety Violations:** Role-play shouldn't bypass safety filters.

## Bias & Neutrality
*   **Cultural Norms:** Social norms vary globally. Specify the cultural context in the prompt.

## Difficulty Scaling
*   **Level 1:** Basic polite vs rude.
*   **Level 2:** Role consistency over 5 turns.
*   **Level 3:** Navigating a social dilemma or faux pas.
