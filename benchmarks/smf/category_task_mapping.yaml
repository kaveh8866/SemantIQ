# 1. Meaning Coherence Benchmarks (MCB)
mcb:
  allowed_types: [qbe, ce]
  discouraged_types: [lfg]
  rationale: >
    Meaning coherence is best measured via short, controlled prompts and contrastive variations (CE)
    to isolate semantic drift. Long-form generation introduces too many uncontrolled variables.

# 2. Context Integration Benchmarks (CIB)
cib:
  allowed_types: [crt, qbe]
  discouraged_types: [ce]
  rationale: >
    Context integration requires multi-turn or fragmented inputs (CRT). Contrastive evaluation
    is less effective here as context state is cumulative, not comparative.

# 3. Nuance & Complexity Benchmarks (NCB)
ncb:
  allowed_types: [qbe, ce]
  discouraged_types: [lfg]
  rationale: >
    Nuance is best tested by comparing responses to subtly different inputs (CE) or asking for
    explicit distinctions (QBE).

# 4. Reasoning & Formal Logic Benchmarks (RFB)
rfb:
  allowed_types: [qbe]
  discouraged_types: [lfg, sbt]
  rationale: >
    Logic is binary and rigorous. It requires direct questions (QBE) with clear right/wrong answers.
    Stress tasks (SBT) introduce ambiguity which invalidates logical proofs.

# 5. Robustness & Adversarial Stability (RAS)
ras:
  allowed_types: [sbt, ce]
  discouraged_types: [qbe]
  rationale: >
    Robustness is tested by attacking the model (SBT). Contrastive evaluation (CE) helps verify
    stability between benign and adversarial prompts. Standard QBE is too easy to game.

# 6. Ethical & Legal Benchmarks (ELB)
elb:
  allowed_types: [rmt, sbt, qbe]
  discouraged_types: [lfg]
  rationale: >
    Ethics involves boundaries (SBT) and self-reflection (RMT). Long-form generation risks
    hallucinating unethical content unnecessarily.

# 7. Social & Situational Benchmarks (SSB)
ssb:
  allowed_types: [crt, ce, qbe]
  discouraged_types: [lfg]
  rationale: >
    Social intelligence relies on context (CRT) and tone adaptation (CE).

# 8. Multilingual & Linguistic Reasoning Benchmarks (MLRB)
mlrb:
  allowed_types: [qbe, ce]
  discouraged_types: [sbt]
  rationale: >
    Translation and linguistic logic are precise skills (QBE). Contrastive evaluation (CE) is
    essential for verifying cross-lingual consistency.

# 9. Creativity & Constraint Benchmarks (CCB)
ccb:
  allowed_types: [lfg, qbe]
  discouraged_types: [ce]
  rationale: >
    Creativity requires space to generate (LFG). Contrastive evaluation punishes the variance
    that creativity rewards.

# 10. Long-Form & Coherence Benchmarks (LFCB)
lfcb:
  allowed_types: [lfg]
  discouraged_types: [qbe, ce, sbt]
  rationale: >
    By definition, this category measures long-form generation (LFG). Short questions (QBE) cannot
    measure long-range coherence.

# 11. Symbolic & Structural Benchmarks (SSB2)
ssb2:
  allowed_types: [qbe, lfg]
  discouraged_types: [sbt]
  rationale: >
    Code and structure require precision (QBE). Some coding tasks are long-form (LFG).

# 12. Query & Grounding Benchmarks (QGB)
qgb:
  allowed_types: [rmt, qbe]
  discouraged_types: [lfg]
  rationale: >
    Grounding requires citing sources and admitting ignorance (RMT). Long-form generation
    increases hallucination risk.

# --- Extensions ---

# Extension A: Domain-Specific Technical Benchmarks (DTB)
dtb:
  allowed_types: [qbe, lfg]
  discouraged_types: [sbt]
  rationale: >
    Technical domains require precise answers (QBE) or complex reports (LFG).

# Extension B: Multimodal Semantics Benchmarks (MSB)
msb:
  allowed_types: [qbe, ce]
  discouraged_types: [lfg]
  rationale: >
    Multimodal reasoning is usually tested via specific questions about an image (QBE).

# Extension C: Emotional & Empathetic Benchmarks (EEB)
eeb:
  allowed_types: [crt, ce]
  discouraged_types: [qbe]
  rationale: >
    Empathy requires understanding the emotional context (CRT) and responding with the right tone (CE).

# Extension D: Dynamic Temporal Benchmarks (DTB2)
dtb2:
  allowed_types: [qbe, crt]
  discouraged_types: [lfg]
  rationale: >
    Time tracking requires maintaining state (CRT) or answering specific logic questions (QBE).

# Extension E: Agentic Workflow Benchmarks (AWM)
awm:
  allowed_types: [lfg, crt]
  discouraged_types: [qbe]
  rationale: >
    Agents operate in loops (LFG/CRT). Single-shot questions (QBE) don't capture workflow.
