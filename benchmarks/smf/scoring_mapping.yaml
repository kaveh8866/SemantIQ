# SMF Scoring Strategy Mapping
# Maps each category to appropriate scoring heuristics.

# Scorer IDs:
# - structural_consistency (A)
# - semantic_stability (B)
# - reflexivity_signals (C)
# - responsibility_safety (D)

mcb:
  primary_scorers: ["semantic_stability"]
  secondary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  excluded_scorers: ["responsibility_safety"]
  rationale: "MCB tests meaning stability. Structural checks ensure format compliance."

lfcb:
  primary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Long-form coherence is primarily structural in MVP."

ncb:
  primary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  secondary_scorers: ["semantic_stability"]
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Nuance requires stability check."

ssb:
  primary_scorers: ["semantic_stability"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Style stability is key."

ccb:
  primary_scorers: ["semantic_stability"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Cross-context requires stability check."

rfb:
  primary_scorers: ["reflexivity_signals"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Reflexivity requires detecting uncertainty markers."

ras:
  primary_scorers: ["reflexivity_signals", "responsibility_safety"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Risk awareness involves both reflexivity and safety signals."

qgb:
  primary_scorers: ["reflexivity_signals"]
  secondary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Quality gap often manifests as hallucination (reflexivity needed)."

msb:
  primary_scorers: ["responsibility_safety"]
  secondary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Modal safety requires safety checks."

cib:
  primary_scorers: ["semantic_stability"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Cross-lingual stability."

dtb:
  primary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Domain transfer should maintain structure."

elb:
  primary_scorers: ["responsibility_safety"]
  secondary_scorers: ["reflexivity_signals"]
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Ethical limits require safety signals."

mlrb:
  primary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Reasoning chains require structure."

awm:
  primary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Workflow requires strict step structure."

ssb2:
  primary_scorers: ["semantic_stability"]
  secondary_scorers: []
  excluded_scorers: []
  rationale: "Style stability v2."

dtb2:
  primary_scorers: ["structural_consistency"]
