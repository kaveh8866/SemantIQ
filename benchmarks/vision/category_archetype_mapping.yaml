mappings:
  single_object_fidelity:
    category_id: sof
    primary_archetypes: [soi]
    secondary_archetypes: [sas]
    discouraged_archetypes: [moc, abc]
    rationale: >
      Single-object evaluation requires isolation to avoid confounds. 
      Style stability (SAS) is a valid secondary check for object rendering under style constraints.

  multi_object_composition:
    category_id: moc
    primary_archetypes: [moc]
    secondary_archetypes: [sra, abc]
    discouraged_archetypes: [soi]
    rationale: >
      Requires multiple entities. SOI is by definition insufficient. 
      SRA and ABC are natural extensions of composition.

  spatial_relations:
    category_id: spr
    primary_archetypes: [sra]
    secondary_archetypes: [moc]
    discouraged_archetypes: [soi]
    rationale: >
      Spatial relations require at least two objects (or object + background) to define a relationship. 
      MOC is closely related.

  attribute_binding_counting:
    category_id: abc
    primary_archetypes: [abc]
    secondary_archetypes: [moc]
    discouraged_archetypes: [soi, sas]
    rationale: >
      Focuses on binding specific attributes to specific objects. 
      SOI is too simple (trivial binding). SAS introduces noise.

  negation_exclusion:
    category_id: nex
    primary_archetypes: [nec]
    secondary_archetypes: [soi]
    discouraged_archetypes: [abc, moc]
    rationale: >
      Testing absence. SOI can be used as a baseline (presence vs absence). 
      Complex scenes (MOC/ABC) make negation verification harder.

  style_stability:
    category_id: stb
    primary_archetypes: [sas]
    secondary_archetypes: [soi]
    discouraged_archetypes: [abc, sra, nec]
    rationale: >
      Style is best evaluated on simple subjects (SOI) to isolate texture/rendering from semantic complexity. 
      Complex logic (ABC/SRA) interferes with style purity assessment.
