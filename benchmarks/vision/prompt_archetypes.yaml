  - archetype_id: soi
    name: Single-Object Isolation
    description: >
      One object, minimal scene, no distractions. Tests the model's fundamental ability to generate a specific entity.

    allowed_variations:
      - object class (common vs. rare)
      - viewpoint (front, side, top)
      - lighting (neutral, studio)
    disallowed_patterns:
      - complex backgrounds
      - interaction with other objects
      - artistic stylization
    typical_failure_modes:
      - object hallucination (extra objects)
      - missing core attributes
      - messy composition

  - archetype_id: moc
    name: Multi-Object Composition
    description: >
      Multiple objects with explicit co-presence requirements. Tests the model's ability to handle scene complexity.

    primary_rubrics:
      - object_count_accuracy
      - object_distinctness
      - scene_coherence

    typical_failure_modes:
      - missing objects
      - object fusion (hybrid creatures)
      - attribute leakage

  - archetype_id: sra
    name: Spatial Relation Assertion
    description: >

      - floating objects

  - archetype_id: abc
    name: Attribute Binding & Counting
    description: >
      Quantities and attributes must be bound to correct instances (e.g., "three red balls and two blue cubes").

      - count_accuracy
      - attribute_binding_precision
      - leakage_resistance
    expected_output_properties:
      - exact counts for each object type
      - attributes (color, texture) bound only to target
    allowed_variations:
      - low counts (1-5)
      - attribute types (color, material, size)
    disallowed_patterns:
      - large crowds (>10)
      - implied attributes
    typical_failure_modes:
      - count errors
      - color bleeding (blue ball, red cube -> purple objects)

  - archetype_id: nec
    name: Negation & Exclusion Constraint
    description: >
      Explicitly forbids objects, attributes, or elements (e.g., "an empty room", "no people").
    primary_categories: [negation_exclusion]
    primary_rubrics:
      - exclusion_adherence
      - negative_constraint_fidelity
      - replacement_logic
    expected_output_properties:
      - absence of forbidden elements
