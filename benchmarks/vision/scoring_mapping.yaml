    rationale: >
      Focuses on the fidelity of a single object. Complex relations or counts are out of scope.

    secondary_rubrics:
      - attribute_fidelity
    excluded_rubrics: []
    rationale: >
      Evaluates ability to compose multiple distinct objects.

      Strictly evaluates spatial relationships and positioning.

    excluded_rubrics: []
    rationale: >
      Testing the "binding problem" and exact counting capabilities.

    excluded_rubrics:
      - counting_accuracy
    rationale: >
      Focuses on what is NOT in the image.

    rationale: >
      Evaluates adherence to style constraints over semantic complexity.
