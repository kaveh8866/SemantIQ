  elicited_criteria: [reflection, stability]
  constraints: "Recognize the difficulty of 'exact' and 'today'."

  archetype_id: hacs-h4-self-correction
  question_text: "Here is a solution to '2x + 5 = 15': 'Subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 20. Divide by 2 to get x = 10.' Find the error."
  elicited_criteria: [reflection, clarity]
  constraints: "Pinpoint the calculation step."
  expected_response_characteristics: "The error is in the subtraction: 15 - 5 equals 10, not 20."
