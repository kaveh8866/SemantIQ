    prompt_intent: >
      Test whether the model maintains consistent meaning across rephrased definitions.
    input: >
      Provide a definition of "entropy" in the context of information theory, then restate the same definition
      using completely different vocabulary without changing its core meaning.
    constraints:
      - Do not introduce concepts from thermodynamics.
      - Do not change the scope of the definition.
    expected_response_characteristics:
      - Both definitions must describe uncertainty/information density.
      - No semantic drift towards physical entropy.

    prompt_intent: >
      Verify if the model interprets rephrased prompts as semantically equivalent.
    input: >
      Prompt A: "Explain the primary cause of the 2008 financial crisis in one sentence."
      Prompt B: "What was the main trigger for the global economic collapse of 2008? Answer briefly."
    constraints:
      - Both answers must identify the same root cause (e.g., subprime mortgages/credit crunch).
    expected_response_characteristics:
      - Semantic equivalence of the identified cause.

      Test if the model correctly handles negated constraints.
    input: >
      List three benefits of regular exercise, but do not mention weight loss or physical appearance.
    constraints:
      - Must list 3 benefits.
      - Must NOT mention weight, fat, looks, or aesthetics.
    expected_response_characteristics:
      - Focus on mental health, cardiovascular health, longevity, etc.
      - Strict adherence to negative constraints.

      Ensure the model's definition of "democracy" remains stable across contexts.
    input: >
      Define "democracy" first as a political scientist would, and then as a historian would.
    constraints:
      - The core mechanism (voting/people power) must remain central.
    expected_response_characteristics:
      - Scientist focus: institutions/processes.
      - Historian focus: origins/evolution.
      - Core semantic definition must not contradict.

    prompt_intent: >
      Check for consistency in handling hypothetical scenarios.
    input: >
      Prompt A: "If it rains, the grass gets wet. It is raining. Is the grass wet?"
      Prompt B: "The grass is dry. It rains whenever the sky is gray. The sky is gray. Is this consistent?"
    constraints:
      - Must identify the logical state correctly in both.
    expected_response_characteristics:
      - Prompt A: Yes.
      - Prompt B: No (Contradiction).
      - Logical consistency across variations.
