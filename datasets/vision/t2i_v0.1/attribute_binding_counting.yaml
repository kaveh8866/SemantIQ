    expected_visual_properties:
      - 3 distinct spheres
      - no color mixing
    typical_failure_modes:
      - 4 balls
      - duplicate colors

    prompt_text: "Two cups: the taller one is black, the shorter one is white."
    intent: Test relative attribute binding (size + color).
    constraints:
      - count must be exactly 2
      - black cup > white cup (height)
    primary_rubrics:
      - attribute_binding_precision

    prompt_text: "Four apples on a table, exactly two of them are green."
    intent: Test subset attribute assignment within a group.
    constraints:

      - green count 2
      - implied other colors (red/yellow)
    primary_rubrics:
      - count_accuracy

    expected_visual_properties:
      - 4 distinct fruits
      - clear color split
    typical_failure_modes:
      - all green
      - wrong total count

      - one shirt plain
      - side by side
    primary_rubrics:
      - attribute_binding_precision

    expected_visual_properties:
      - pattern limited to one object
      - no pattern bleeding
    typical_failure_modes:
      - both striped
      - both plain

    category_id: abc
    archetype_id: abc
    prompt_text: "A small dog and a large dog standing next to each other."
    intent: Test size attribute binding on animate objects.
    constraints:
      - two dogs
      - distinct size difference
    primary_rubrics:
      - attribute_binding_precision
      - semantic_coherence
    expected_visual_properties:
      - one clearly larger
      - same species/type generally
