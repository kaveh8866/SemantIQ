# Community Adoption: Educators & Students

## Learning with SemantIQ
SemantIQ is an excellent tool for teaching:
- **NLP Evaluation**: How do we measure "understanding" vs. "pattern matching"?
- **Bias & Ethics**: Hands-on exploration of how models fail on sensitive prompts.
- **Multimodal AI**: Understanding the challenges of aligning text and image.

### Classroom Activities
1.  **The "Failure Mode" Lab**: Have students run SMF on a small open-source model (e.g., Llama-3-8B) and analyze *qualitatively* why it got certain questions wrong.
2.  **Prompt Engineering vs. Robustness**: Challenge students to rephrase SMF prompts to "trick" the model or help it succeed, illustrating the fragility of current LLMs.
3.  **Rater Reliability**: Use the HACS CLI tools to have students rate model outputs and calculate their own Inter-Rater Reliability (ICC).

### Contribution
Students are encouraged to contribute!
- **Documentation**: Help make our docs clearer.
- **New Examples**: Submit new test cases for existing categories (following the contribution guide).
- **Visualization**: Build better charts for the UI.
