# Post-Release Review Cadence

To ensure continuous improvement, we adhere to a fixed review schedule.

## Quarterly Benchmark Review
**Frequency**: Every 3 months.
**Participants**: Benchmark Stewards.
**Agenda**:
1.  **Issue Triage**: Review all open `methodology-question` issues.
2.  **Health Check**: Analyze score distributions for saturation.
3.  **Adoption**: Review citation counts and community feedback.
**Output**: Plan for the next Minor Release (e.g., v1.1).

## Annual Methodological Audit
**Frequency**: Every 12 months.
**Participants**: Core Maintainers + External Advisors.
**Agenda**:
1.  **Validity Check**: Is "SMF" still measuring what we think it is?
2.  **Literature Review**: Are our metrics (ICC, etc.) still state-of-the-art?
3.  **Strategic Shift**: Do we need to add new domains (e.g., Audio, Video)?
**Output**: Roadmap for the next Major Release (e.g., v2.0).

## Transparency Reports
**Frequency**: With every Major/Minor release.
**Content**:
- Summary of changes.
- Acknowledgment of contributors.
- Disclosure of any known bugs or contamination events in previous versions.
