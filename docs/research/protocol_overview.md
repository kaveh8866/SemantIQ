# Research Protocol Overview

## Ethics & Human Subjects
This benchmark involves human raters (HACS) and automated model evaluations. 

### Disclaimer
- **Not Diagnostic**: Scores from this benchmark are for research purposes only and should not be used to diagnose human cognitive abilities or select personnel.
- **Not for High-Stakes Decision Making**: Do not use these scores as the sole criterion for deploying models in safety-critical environments.

### Human Rater Protection
- **Anonymity**: Raters are identified only by a pseudonymous `rater_id`. No personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, emails, or IP addresses is stored in the public dataset.
- **Consent**: By submitting ratings, contributors consent to the public release of their ratings under the CC-BY 4.0 license.
- **Fairness**: We strive to recruit a diverse pool of raters to minimize cultural and linguistic bias.

## Study Design
- **Objective**: To evaluate the semantic alignment and human-AI comparability of multimodal models.
- **Methodology**: Mixed-methods approach using automated scoring (SMF) and human judgment (HACS).

## Data Management
- **Storage**: All rating data is stored in standard CSV/JSON formats.
- **Versioning**: Data is version-controlled alongside the code to ensure reproducibility.
